# Cannes Festival Project

This is a complete application for handling accomodation and organisation of the Cannes festival.

This project is an old student project back in 2018.

The project is split in two different applications :

- A web application coded in html, css, javascript and PHP for backend. This web application is design according to the Model-Vue-Controller architecture.
- A java application for organisation of the different shows and projections of the cannes festival.

In order to interconnect the two applications, a SQL database is present.

The goal of this project was to learn how to connect 2 applications serving the same global goal.
